🏡 House Price Prediction
This project aims to explore and predict house prices using machine learning techniques. It leverages a dataset containing various features that influence housing prices, such as number of rooms, location, and area.

🧠 Model Performance
(Optional — Add a short summary of the best-performing model's results here, e.g., R² score or RMSE)
Example:

Best model: Linear Regression

R² Score: 0.7374

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 66,894 on average , the model's prediction deviate from actual price by 66k

📌 Future Work
